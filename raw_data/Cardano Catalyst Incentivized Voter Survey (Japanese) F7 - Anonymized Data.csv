I don't know how much recruitment proposal is progressing and how to pay and consume the assigned expenses.
For example, we have a virtual space used in a virtual summit, such as catalyst city or catalyst village, and divide it in a block or street for each Found, and a site section and buildings for each proposal. It describes visually constructing according to the progress, expresses the money you are spending in a picture with money, as well as a picture with money. Something like that, the completed thing can be set up a symbol flag, and you can fly to a site where you can get the necessary information directly ... I just visit while walking virtually (laughs). I think that if you make a good idea of ​​gaining such playfulness and detailed information, you will be able to update your interests and information at all times, and you will be able to grasp the active excitement.
Surely, if the proposer is always exposed to voters and holders, I wonder if it will be able to maintain moderate pressure and responsibility ...
I don't even know the technical things, so I don't know the difficulty or the effect, but I'm glad if such a catalist proposal comes out.
