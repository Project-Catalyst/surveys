I tend to vote against proposals that have already received significant external and public funding outside of Catalyst.

When there is a lot of competition on a particular challenge and the proposals I voted for have already filled the total budget allocation, I start revisiting proposals that I had initially abstained from voting on. In some cases I vote against and in others I maintain my abstention, it depends on my perception of how much I think these proposals would have a greater impact than those I'm supporting.

And in general I also vote against proposals that score below 3, but I don't rely solely on the scores of the CAs.

In the case of proposals for which I have already written assessments, I make a pre-list in the voter tool, where I select only the proposals that I am confident of voting for or against, then I check if my pre-list is within the available budget, if there is still space, I tend to review the proposals that I left with a neutral/abstaining vote and I'll ponder the proposals that I was in doubt, until I create a list that fits into the budget for a given challenge.

I do this same process and adjust my bar according to the competition in each challenge.

When there are challenges that I have little information/expertise to assess, I usually check the CA assessments and see if there are any voting recommendations among the profiles of people I follow in the community. I try to read all of the proposals, even if it's just a brief read/partial read to understand the concept and check that the CA assessments are in line with what I've read previously. I tend to avoid voting on challenges that are out of my interest or just vote on the highest rated and lowest rated proposals of those challenges, to check if there is any distortion in the scores that may have been caused in the assessments stage.",I believe it changed little.

I believe that delegation of vote is necessary for a decent participation of votes per proposal and that the concept of ""expert ballot""(i know Phil doesnt like this term hehe) needs to be worked on further.
